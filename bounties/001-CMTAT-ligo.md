## Description
### Goal :
Creation of a library using LIGOLang for Tezos. The library must implement the [CMTA Token](https://cmta.ch/standards/cmta-token-cmtat) developed by CMTA to tokenise securities in compliance with the Swiss law.

After completion of the bounty, the library may be made available in the ligo [registry](https://packages.ligolang.org/packages).

### Scopes : 
- Creation of library 
  - Has to be compliant with [CMTAT guidelines](https://cmta.ch/standards/cmta-token-cmtat)
  - Code constraint have to be available as [here for TZIP12](https://github.com/ligolang/contract-catalogue/blob/main/lib/fa2/common/tzip12.interfaces.jsligo)
  - Implemented function can be called as [here for NFT](https://github.com/ligolang/contract-catalogue/blob/main/lib/fa2/nft/nft.impl.jsligo)
  - Has to be tested with LIGO tests.
- Creation of the documentation related to the library.

## Bounty Bonus  
- Clean open-source project using your library is available (+600xtz)
- Blog post on how to use your library is published. (+400xtx)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interface code has to be documented
- Current LIGO version has to be used
- Resources are in english
- Readme is available and explains how to use the library (will be posted into registry)
- User experience to use the library has been validated by the LIGO team
- Security audit has been done and accepted by the LIGO team
- If bonus have been done, they have been validated by the LIGO team

## To apply for this bounty you should:
- Understand Tezos and at least one syntax of LIGO
- Understand the [CMTA Standard](https://cmta.ch/standards/standard-for-the-tokenization-of-shares-of-swiss-corporations-using-the-distributed-ledger-technology)
- Understand the [CMTAT Token](https://cmta.ch/standards/cmta-token-cmtat)

## Selection Process
LIGO core team will examine your profile. If you are selected we will contact you. The bounty will ideally attributed to 1 person. If bonus are not done, other bounties may be created to handle them.
LIGO core team or Tezos core team are not available to participate to the bounty.

## To help you on bounty completion 
- You will have a special channel on slack where you can contact members of the LIGO core team. They will try to answer to your questions quickly
- You can use the already existing [FA library](https://packages.ligolang.org/package/@ligo/fa)
- You can follow the structure of [FA library](https://github.com/ligolang/contract-catalogue)
- An [example implementation exist in Smartpy](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT-Tezos-FA2)
- An [example implementation exist in Solidity](https://github.com/CMTA/CMTAT)

## Development process
- Keep your ongoing code in a public repository (a fork of the [CMTAT-Ligo](https://github.com/ligolang/CMTAT-Ligo) repository). 
- Provide weekly updates through Discord or slack channel. 
- Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread. We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.
- The code is merged in [CMTAT-Ligo](https://github.com/ligolang/CMTAT-Ligo) repository.
